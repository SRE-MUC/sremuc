We’re excited to announce the next Meetup of the Site Reliability Engineering Munich group for September 26th.

This time around we will be meeting at Google in their Isarvalley event space! Lets all meet up again, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).

Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

## Topics

### Postmortem Culture at Google

Postmortems are one of the key tools of SREs to not repeat the same mistakes and learn from past incidents. This introductory talk explains how to write a good Postmortem that can strengthen company culture when mistakes happen. Martin has been working in SRE at Google for many years now and will give you an insight into how Google does Postmortems.

### Eliminating human error using self-service GitOps with Crossplane

In this talk, we are going to present what the typical challenges of a Platform team are. We will highlight the importance of self-service GitOps in a banking environment, and will explain how these principles are implemented at DKB, using the open source projects Crossplane and Flux.
Speaker

### Open Discussion

Following the theme we started in our last Meetup, we want to discuss certain topics that the SRE community might be interested in. Examples could be the recent license change in Terraform, or the application of Generative AI in the field of Operations. We look forward to engaging in insightful conversations, fostering mutual learning, and collectively expanding our knowledge base.
