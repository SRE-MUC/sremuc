Weâ€™re excited to announce the next Meetup of the Site Reliability Engineering Munich group for April 25th from 6:30 PM to 9:30 PM CEST at Jambit in Munich.
Let's all meet up again, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).
Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.
Please help to spread The Word! Feel free to post this event on social media using the #sremuc hashtag.
You can reach the organizers at muc@sre.xyz (Ideas, Presentations, Comments)

## Abstracts

### Talk 1: Simplicity in the Source (Markus Teich, Google)

Markus has been an SRE and software engineer at Google for close to 7 years.
In his open source endeavours he learned a few things about running open source software and how code simplicity can help with long term maintenance.
As an SRE at Google Markus has looked through many different types of code bases across various languages.
In this talk he'll share some of his observations on how code can be easier to understand and how that can help with incident management and maintenance.

### Talk 2: Enough Go, what about Rust? (Mario Ortiz Manero, Lyft)

Working on the [open source project Tremor](https://www.tremor.rs/) - an event processing system - Mario has gathered some good knowledge about using rust to write production systems that can scale.
He is going to give us valuable insights when Rust is a great language to use and where it can possibly win over the hearts of dedicated Gophers.

### Talk 3: Recap SREcon Americas (Ingo Averdunk, IBM)

Following the theme from previous years, Ingo will recap SREcon 2024 Americas. Just like speed dating, Ingo will attempt to collapse 3 conference days into a 30-minute session.
The objective is to provide food for thought and to encourage listening to the playback of interesting sessions.
