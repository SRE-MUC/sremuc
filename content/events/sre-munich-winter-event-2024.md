We're co-hosting with Grafana & Friends meetup group https://www.meetup.com/grafana-and-friends-munich/. Come and see new faces!

This time around we will be meeting at Nordcloud in their Highlight Towers location Let's all meet up again, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).

Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

Please help to spread The Word! Feel free to post this event on social media using the #sremuc hashtag!

## Abstracts

### Talk 1: Philosophy of Observability

About the speaker: Richard Hartmann is Director of Community at Grafana Labs

No slides, as this was an open discussion and history lesson.

### Talk 2: Navigating Observability with OTel and Grafana: A Strategic Overview

In this presentation we are going to dive into the interplay between OpenTelemetry (OTel) and Grafana within the AWS landscape. We'll focus on the challenges and solutions for scaling OTel collectors and Grafana agents, with a special emphasis on the challenges of tracing sampling. This talk is tailored to shed light on creating a scalable, robust observability framework in cloud-native environments, and will also touch on the different deployment scenarios, balancing technical depth with practical insights.

About the speaker: Nadya Shakhat, a Cloud Architect at Nordcloud and a certified GCP Professional Architect and Data Engineer, brings a decade of experience in software development, DevOps and observability. Her journey includes significant contributions to open-source projects like OpenStack, particularly as a core contributor to the OpenStack Telemetry project. At Nordcloud and IBM, Nadya focuses on crafting scalable data and observability solutions for diverse clientele, leveraging her deep expertise in monitoring and cloud technologies.

### Talk 3: Navigating the Nuances of GitOps in an Enterprise Environment

GitOps has emerged as a leading approach for infrastructure management, but its implementation can be challenging due to the diversity of tools, legacy systems, and organizational factors involved. This talk will delve into the common pitfalls and complexities of large-scale GitOps deployments, exploring strategies to streamline operations without compromising flexibility.
We'll address technical aspects, architectural considerations, security implications, work methodologies, organizational structures, and the role of Developer Experience (DevEx) in shaping a successful GitOps implementation.

About the Speaker: Bernard's professional career has been growing at an intersection of networking, SW engineering and infra-engineering fields. He used to run an ISP (Internet Service Provider) company as a hobby and that's where his love for the Linux ecosystem sparked. This has naturally evolved through DevOps-like roles into cloud platform engineering nowadays. He is leading a team of Kubernetes consultants with a focus on on-prem and hybrid-cloud platforms.
