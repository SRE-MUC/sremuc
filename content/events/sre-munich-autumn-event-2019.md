## Speakers

* **Ingo Averdunk** is a Distinguished Engineer in IBM and is responsible for Cloud Service Management and Site Reliability Engineering in the Cloud Adoption, Method and Solution Engineering office for IBM Cloud.
* **Dan** is an Engineering Manager at Google and future space traveler.
* **Pavlos Ratis** is a Site Reliability Engineer at HolidayCheck and maintainer of the Awesome SRE repository (https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-sre).
* **Costas** is working as a Site Reliability Engineer for Kentik's Operations team, maintaining a sizeable hybrid infrastructure that hosts Kentik's realtime, SaaS network analytics platform. His interests lie where the network, systems and software meet and lately he's finding DevOps and SRE paradigms to allow for a perfect combination of the above. Lately he's trying to get more familiar with the Cloud side of things to in order to increase the uniformity in Kentik's hybrid infrastructure, but for now he's mostly trying to read behind the buzzwords.

## Abstracts

* Recap SREcon 2019 EMEA: Once a year, SREcon gathers the community of SREs to share experience and learn from each other. This will be a recap of SREcon EMEA 2019 (October 02-04, Dublin, Ireland) . Key themes of the conference were Comprehension, Understandability, and Predictability. Ingo and Pavlos will share their observations from the conference, and highlight several sessions worth listening to as a replay.
* Kentik utilizes multiple auxiliary sources to enrich ingested flow, with the most prominent of them being data sourced from BGP peerings.
In this presentation we'll go through all the different generations of the setup, the challenges and the requirements we had to work with at each step of process, in order to be able to scale to more than 4000 IPv4 + IPv6 BGP sessions today.

## Participation

We're always looking for 20-45 minute (technical) talks related to the very broad field of Site Reliability Engineering. Get in touch with the organizers if you'd like to present!
