This time around we will be meeting at Netlight right in the heart of Munich (Monday, April 14, 2025
6:00 PM to 9:00 PM CEST). Let's all meet up, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).

Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

## Abstracts

### Talk 1: Own your genAI workloads
Let's explore how to construct vendor-agnostic Generative AI solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), using open-weight Large Language Models while retaining complete control over your AI components. Tim will discuss the challenges and benefits of deploying these models and their associated components on Kubernetes, highlighting the critical aspects of ensuring data security and compliance.

Tim Fischer (Senior Consultant, Netlight) is a Senior Consultant at Netlight, specializing in cloud, infrastructure and Kubernetes. He helps clients navigate the GenAI landscape, providing insights into creating flexible and secure AI solutions at scale.

### Talk 2: Introducing a product mindset to an infrastructure platform

You are working on a platform providing infrastructure services for developer teams, but how can you show the value it brings to higher management? This talk will focus on how the online bank DKB introduced a product mindset to its infrastructure platform to be able to solve just this problem. We will dive deeper into:

* how Platform Engineering compares to Site Reliability Engineering,
* better defining the platform and its maturity,
* clarifying what product mindset is and how to bring it to the team

Stéphane Di Cesare (Platform Engineer/Architect, DKB) is a Senior Platform Engineer in the Platform Experience team at the German online bank DKB. He is helping to increase the adoption and advocate for the value of the bank's container platform. Stéphane is focusing on bridging the gap between engineering and users by clarifying how technology can bring value to them. He is a former Accenture and VMware employee, and has background with technology consulting, infrastructure automation, sales, support and QA.

### Talk 3: SREBot

A talk around SREBot, the open-source AI project Daniel is spearheading
https://github.com/checkly/srebot

Daniel Paulus (VP Of Engineering, Checkly) is working with super cool people at [checklyhq.com](checklyhq.com) building a world class developer focused product for monitoring your APIs and websites. He is a seasoned veteran when it comes to conference and meetup talks, he recently recorded a podcast with Lena Reinhard, spoken at GopheRec in Berlin and the SRE NYC meetup last December.

### Talk 4: Running Kubernetes clusters across multiple clouds for large automotive companies

So you want to run Kubernetes clusters at all big automotive?
This talk is about Applied Intuition's experience in running our simulation software at basically all big and many small automotive companies, across 4 public clouds, private clouds, and on-prem. We discuss how Kubernetes makes this possible, operational challenges, how to scale to large variety with few engineers, and how to interface well with corporate IT.

Steve Wolter (Production Engineer, Applied Intuition) is passionate about making infrastructure simple for 12 years in the industry, ever since trying to make microscopes work well without the right infrastructure. He is currently Production Engineer at Applied Intuition Munich, former Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Google Corp Eng SRE and Staff Software Engineer at Intrinsic (an Alphabet Robotics company).
