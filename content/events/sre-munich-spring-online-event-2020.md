We’re excited to announce the next Meetup of the Site Reliability Engineering Munich group for April 23rd. This time we are taking things online due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation. The topic for this session is “What kind of SRE am I?” - We’ll hear from SREs in Munich and other cities in the world about their experiences of being an SRE.

## Agenda

* 18:30 Join the online meeting
* 18:45 Intro
* 19:00 SRE Round Table “What SRE means to me and my team?” and "What kind of SRE am I?"
* 20:00 Open floor, discussion, and questions around the topic
* 20:30 End

As this is a collective effort to get a glimpse of what SRE means to different people and companies, we encourage the attendees of the meetup to fill out the following survey:

We hope that we will get enough samples to perform an analysis and show the results to you in a future meetup.

## Participation

Ideally, we'd like to hear everybody's opinion. However, we'll try to use 2 min slots (depending on the participating) for everybody to give their opinion on the matter. Make sure you're in a quiet environment. As long as you're not speaking to the microphone, keep yourself muted so that the recording won't get accidental background sounds. Please use the chat to ask questions and get your turn.

We're always looking for 20-35 minute (technical) talks related to the very broad field of Site Reliability Engineering. Get in touch with the organizers if you'd like to present!

## Legal

There may be audio and video recordings of the talks with the purpose of sharing the learnings and advertising future events. By attending the event you give your consent to be recorded.

Spread The Word! Feel free to refer to this Meetup on social media using the #sremuc hashtag!
