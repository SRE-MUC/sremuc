We’re excited to announce the next Meetup of the Site Reliability Engineering Munich group for February 13th.
This time around we will be meeting at MaibornWolff as they have graciously agreed to host us! Lets all meet up once again, 
talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers 
(and folks that aspire to be one!). Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share 
ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

We would like to thank MaibornWolff for sponsoring this event and catering it!

## Abstracts

###  Talk 1

Building a reliable and maintainable platform is hard, even if you have a large amount of people and resources available. 
Let’s imagine, you need to build a platform, which you have to hand over to someone else — immediately your bar is set higher.
Let us show you methodologies, how to find the right tools for a cloud-native project, common problems as well as what you need to 
tackle, in order to make the platform operable for your customer.

Learn from real project stories and receive practical hints for using CNCF products for a ready-to-operate platform.

### Talk 2

Organizations that build and deploy cloud-native software are faced with the challenge of building and maintaining infrastructure for 
the development and testing of their software. Development ergonomics and testing quality tend to be at odds with keeping costs and complexity low. 
mirrord “mirrors” the environment of a Kubernetes cluster to local processes in real-time. We’ll explore how organizations can employ mirrord to 
give their developers the best cloud development experience, all while simplifying the development infrastructure.

### Talk 3

A recap of SREcon 2022 Europe.

## Participation

We're always looking for 20-45 minute (technical) talks related to the very broad field of Site Reliability Engineering.
Get in touch with the organizers if you'd like to present!
