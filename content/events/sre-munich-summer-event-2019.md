* Anatomy of a SRE and DevOps transformation: Keeping your IT service organization in the state of the art is key for the company success. 3 years ago we started our SRE and DevOps journey.
* With 3000+ infrastrucutre nodes, a legacy task based organization and a clear split between Operations and Development it promised to be a chalenging journey... And it was! Come and deep dive with us in this mindset, skill set, organizational and processes revolution. From our initial plan to the current setup we will share with you the good, the bad and the ugly
* Recap SREcon 2019 Americas: Once a year, SREcon gathers the community of SREs to share experience and learn from each other. This will be a recap of SREcon Americas 2019 (March 25-27, Brooklyn) . Key themes of the conference were Comprehension, Understandability, and Predictability. Ingo will share his observations from the conference, and highlight several session worth listening to as a replay.
