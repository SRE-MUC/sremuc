We’re excited to announce the next Meetup of the Site Reliability Engineering Munich group for June 13th.

This time around we will be meeting at Netlight as they have graciously agreed to host us!
Lets all meet up again, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).
Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

We would like to thank Netlight Consulting for sponsoring this event and catering it!

## Abstracts

### Talk 1

How can I start practicing Gamedays at my company? In this talk we are going to
dive deeper into the organization of the event, from identifying incidents to
run, execution and logistics to disaster recovery. Lastly, we will have a look
at results and feedback we have received.

### Talk 2

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a common pattern in building modern
service-oriented applications. It helps decoupling system components, which
enables scaling, updating and deploying them independently. However, EDA comes
with its own set of challenges and trade-offs. In this presentation we'll talk
about reliability considerations around GCP Pub/Sub, our event broker of choice
to implement EDA. We'll mainly focus on publisher reliability and how to
monitor it, dead-letter queues and message retrying.

### Talk 3

In this talk, we are going to present what the typical challenges of a Platform
team are. We will highlight the importance of self-service GitOps in a banking
environment, and will explain how these principles are implemented at DKB,
using the open source projects Crossplane and Flux.
