We're co-hosting our Wiesn event. This time around we will be meeting at Nordcloud in their Highlight Towers location Let's all meet up again, talk about reliability, exchange ideas and see where we can continue to learn on our journey as site reliability engineers (and folks that aspire to be one!).

Meetups are about engaging within the community, so we are looking to everyone to share ideas and learn to ultimately to reduce the risk of disasters.

## Abstracts

### OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes
In this session, we will explore whether and how OpenTelemetry can transform infrastructure monitoring within Kubernetes environments, either as an alternative to or in conjunction with Prometheus. We’ll also discuss how infrastructure and application monitoring together can form a comprehensive observability solution in the context of Kubernetes. Additionally, we’ll examine the evolving landscape of Kubernetes monitoring, including the role of vendor-specific agents and the potential risks of vendor lock-in. The talk will conclude with practical strategies for deploying OpenTelemetry agents using Helm charts, Kubernetes operators, and vendor-managed solutions.

Nadya Shakhat is Cloud Architect at Nordcloud

### Internal Cloud Platform (Piotr Hajdas, BMW AG)
Piotr will provide a brief intro of the BMW Standard Cloud Platform for AWS, a strategic platform to host standardized workloads.

Piotr Hajdas is Project Lead Internal Cloud Platform (AWS) at BMW AG
