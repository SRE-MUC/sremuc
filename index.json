Let’s imagine, you need to build a platform, which you have to hand over to someone else — immediately your bar is set higher. Let us show you methodologies, how to find the right tools for a cloud-native project, common problems as well as what you need to tackle, in order to make the platform operable for your customer.\nLearn from real project stories and receive practical hints for using CNCF products for a ready-to-operate platform.\nSlides: /slides/building_reliable_and_maintainable_platform.pdf Talk 2 # Organizations that build and deploy cloud-native software are faced with the challenge of building and maintaining infrastructure for the development and testing of their software. Development ergonomics and testing quality tend to be at odds with keeping costs and complexity low. mirrord “mirrors” the environment of a Kubernetes cluster to local processes in real-time.

At Google, we run large production fleets that serve Google products like YouTube and Gmail. To support all our employees, including engineers, we also run a sizable corporate fleet with hundreds of thousands of devices across multiple platforms, models, and locations. To let each Googler work in the environment they are most productive in, we operate many OS-platforms including a Linux system. For a long time, our internal-facing Linux distribution, Goobuntu, was based off of Ubuntu LTS releases. In 2018 we completed a move to a rolling release model based on Debian.\nTalk 3 # Following the theme from previous years, Ingo Averdunk will recap SREcon 2022 Americas.

Its main premise is that operations can be automated using monitoring data to reduce the workload of operators (e.g., SREs or production engineers). Our current research explores how AIOps – and many related fields such as deep learning, machine learning, distributed traces, graph analysis, time-series analysis, sequence analysis, advanced statistics, NLP and log analysis – can be explored to effectively detect, localize, predict, and remediate failures in large-scale cloud infrastructures (\u0026gt;50 regions and AZs) by analyzing service management data (e.g., distributed traces, logs, events, alerts, metrics). In particular, this talk will describe how a particular monitoring data structure, called distributed traces, can be analyzed using deep learning to identify anomalies in its spans. This capability empowers operators to quickly identify which components of a distributed system are faulty.\nTitle: The Road to SRE # Abstract: Building and establishing a SRE team is a complex challenge that involves a lot more than just overcoming technical hurdles. Especially in the context of a fast-growing startup there are quite some lessons to be learned. The talk walks through the evolution of the operations/SRE team at Instana. From the early beginnings, having just a handful of well-meaning family and friends customers, winging features and deployments left and right over platform re-architectures and team growth to the present day with customers all around the world to whom we want to offer a frictionless 24/7 availability and product experience. During this time, we doubted, changed and learned a lot of things - some of them obvious, some of them not so much - around tooling, technology, architecture as well as processual and organizational topics.\nSpeakers # Dr. Jorge Cardoso is Chief Architect for Planet-scale AIOps at Huawei’s Ireland and Munich Research Centers. Before, he worked for several major companies such as SAP Research (Germany) on the Internet of Services and the Boeing Company in Seattle (USA) on Enterprise Application Integration. He previously gave lectures at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), University of Georgia (USA), University of Coimbra and University of Madeira (Portugal). His current research involves the development of the next generation of AIOps platforms and Cloud operations tools driven by AI to increase Cloud reliability and resilience. He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia (USA). Bastian Spanneberg (@spanneberg) is part of the SRE team at Instana and has seen the company grow and evolve from the early days Participation # We\u0026rsquo;re always looking for 20-35 minute (technical) talks related to the very broad field of Site Reliability Engineering.
