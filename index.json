Full automation is a must - at that scale manual toil is time consuming and error prone. Full control is necessary as well - on-call engineers need to interact with the automation to pause the rollout, resume it or roll back. And most important: the automation needs to be safe - taking into account signals from monitoring systems to automatically detect problems caused by the rollout (and react to them in an appropriate way). A full rollout can take several days - potentially weeks. So any automation must be able to deal with interruptions, intermittent upgrades or even temporary downtime of the automation system itself. With Temporal.io and its \u0026ldquo;durable execution\u0026rdquo; paradigm, the rollout automation system developed for the ClickHouse Cloud addresses all those concerns.\nMichael Lex is a seasoned engineer who has worked in various fields ranging from consulting to fast-paced startups. He currently works as an Engineering Manager at Clickhouse where he and his team work on friction-less deployments of stateful applications for thousands of customers.\nSlides: Clickhouse\nTalk 2: Lessons learned from 15 years DevOps (Paul Stack, System Initiative) # It\u0026rsquo;s almost 15 years since the inception of DevOps. The core value of DevOps was to break down the silos and improve communication to achieve stability, reliability, availability, and security. In the boom of the ecosystem since that point, it sometimes feels like we\u0026rsquo;ve created more silos and stemmed communication in every way with the tooling we have. What if we take the lessons we’ve learned along the way and try to reimagine DevOps tooling to fulfill the original promise of the DevOps movement? What if we could remove the 200% problem (the need to know a specialist language AND a cloud framework) from our tooling? What if we could focus on delivery in a collaborative manner rather than communicating via a series of handoffs via pull requests? It’s time for a second wave of DevOps tools.\nIn this talk, Paul is going to reflect on the lessons we\u0026rsquo;ve learned along the DevOps journey, for example Infrastructure as Code, and talk about the work System Initiative is doing to revolutionize how people collaborate to build and maintain complex infrastructure. System Initiative is the beginning of an ecosystem to create a real-time, multiplayer, multi-modal reinvention of DevOps tooling. System Initiative provides a modern, state of the art approach to infrastructure management that increases productivity with its simulation-based workflow.\nOnce you see what it’s possible to achieve, you won’t want to settle any longer.\nPaul Stack is an infrastructure coder and has spoken at various events throughout the world about his passion for continuous integration, continuous delivery and good operational procedures and why they should be part of what developers and system administrators do on a day to day basis. He believes that reliably delivering software is more important than its development. Paul’s passions are the DevOps and Continuous Delivery movements and how they help the entire business and its customers.\nSlides: It\u0026rsquo;s time to rebuild DevOps\nPhotos # Participation # We\u0026rsquo;re always looking for 20-45 minute (technical) talks related to the very broad field of Site Reliability Engineering.

Starting with the overall roadmap of SRE at SIXT, Andreas will zoom into details on platform security (AMI re-rolling, Image scanning via Crowdstrike), deployments via CI Bot and service discovery, as well as the use of OPA for Kafka Authorization and Authentication.\nTalk 2 # Kordian Bruck will present How Google got to rolling Linux releases for Desktops. At Google, we run large production fleets that serve Google products like YouTube and Gmail. To support all our employees, including engineers, we also run a sizable corporate fleet with hundreds of thousands of devices across multiple platforms, models, and locations. To let each Googler work in the environment they are most productive in, we operate many OS-platforms including a Linux system. For a long time, our internal-facing Linux distribution, Goobuntu, was based off of Ubuntu LTS releases. In 2018 we completed a move to a rolling release model based on Debian.\nTalk 3 # Following the theme from previous years, Ingo Averdunk will recap SREcon 2022 Americas. Just like speed dating, Ingo will attempt to collapse 3 conference days into a 30 min session. The objective is to provide food for thought, and to encourage listening to the playback of interesting sessions.\nLegal # There may be audio and video recordings of the talks with the purpose of sharing the learnings and advertising future events.

Its main premise is that operations can be automated using monitoring data to reduce the workload of operators (e.g., SREs or production engineers). Our current research explores how AIOps – and many related fields such as deep learning, machine learning, distributed traces, graph analysis, time-series analysis, sequence analysis, advanced statistics, NLP and log analysis – can be explored to effectively detect, localize, predict, and remediate failures in large-scale cloud infrastructures (\u0026gt;50 regions and AZs) by analyzing service management data (e.g., distributed traces, logs, events, alerts, metrics). In particular, this talk will describe how a particular monitoring data structure, called distributed traces, can be analyzed using deep learning to identify anomalies in its spans. This capability empowers operators to quickly identify which components of a distributed system are faulty.\nTitle: The Road to SRE # Abstract: Building and establishing a SRE team is a complex challenge that involves a lot more than just overcoming technical hurdles. Especially in the context of a fast-growing startup there are quite some lessons to be learned. The talk walks through the evolution of the operations/SRE team at Instana. From the early beginnings, having just a handful of well-meaning family and friends customers, winging features and deployments left and right over platform re-architectures and team growth to the present day with customers all around the world to whom we want to offer a frictionless 24/7 availability and product experience. During this time, we doubted, changed and learned a lot of things - some of them obvious, some of them not so much - around tooling, technology, architecture as well as processual and organizational topics.\nSpeakers # Dr. Jorge Cardoso is Chief Architect for Planet-scale AIOps at Huawei’s Ireland and Munich Research Centers. Before, he worked for several major companies such as SAP Research (Germany) on the Internet of Services and the Boeing Company in Seattle (USA) on Enterprise Application Integration. He previously gave lectures at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany), University of Georgia (USA), University of Coimbra and University of Madeira (Portugal). His current research involves the development of the next generation of AIOps platforms and Cloud operations tools driven by AI to increase Cloud reliability and resilience. He has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia (USA).
